# Gesture-Controlled Car with Accelerometer
In this project, I build a car that can be controlled by my hand movements! It uses an Arduino and Arduino Micro as well as some DC motors and an MPU6050 accelerometer.

# Final Milestone

# Second Milestone

# First Milestone
  
My first milestone was setting up all four car motors and spinning them all simultaneously with an Arduino connected to an h-bridge. I ran into some trouble with the wires falling out, which was solved by screwing them into place. Also, the motors wouldn't all spin at the same time so I needed to fiddle with the code and Arduino pins until they all did. I learned a lot over this week. I had to solder the wires onto the motors and use Arduino IDE to make the motors spin.
