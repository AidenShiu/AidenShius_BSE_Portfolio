# Gesture-Controlled Car with Accelerometer
In this project, I build a car that can be controlled forward, backward, left, or right by my hand movements!

# First Milestone
  
My first milestone was setting up all four car motors and spinning them all at the same time with an Arduino connected to an h-bridge. I ran into some trouble with the wires falling out though that was solved by screwing them into place. Also, the motors didn't all spin at the same time so I needed to fiddle with the code and Arduino pins until they all did. I learned a lot over this week: soldering, electrical, and arduino (code, etc).
